# Introduction:
This project focuses on creating a dynamic healthcare analytics dashboard using Power BI to analyze hospital emergency room data, including patient wait times, satisfaction scores, and visit patterns, aiming to uncover insights that can improve healthcare efficiency and patient experience.

# Project Files:
- **Dashboard File:** The Power BI dashboard file is available here:
- **Data Files:** The data file in Microsoft Excel Comma Separated Values File (.csv) format is available here:
- **Dashboard Images:** The images used in the dashboard are available here:
- **Dashboard Canvas Background:** I created the dashboardâ€™s canvas background in Microsoft Office PowerPoint and then saved the final product as an JPEG image. Both the files are available here: ![Dashboard Canvas Background](https://github.com/MadhurShekharBand/PowerBI_Project_-_Healthcare_Analytics_Dashboard/tree/d60c688daa1a49f080437ef723a7fe4b6cdfffd4/Dashboard%20Canvas%20Background)

# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others' work to find optimal jobs.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

### About the Dataset:
Dataset used for this project is available here:
It's a real-world data science job postings data from 2023 packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### Tools I Used:
- **Microsoft SQL Server:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data and executing SQL queries.
- **Microsoft Power BI:** The chosen BI tool used to visualize my SQL query outputs.
